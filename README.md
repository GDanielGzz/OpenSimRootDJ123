Instructions:


1. Download Complete File named "DJ123OpenSimRootLowP".

2. Run "OpenSimRoot.exe" located inside the Folder.

3. After the simulation is finished, or at any point during the simulation, opening tabled_output.xls will show all the numeric results given by the simulation so far.

4. VTP files are created at a rate of one per simulated day; To view the full 3D from day 0 to the finish date, visualisationRoots.polylines.pvd should be run.

5. These files can be opened in graphical viewers, such as Paraview.

6. Modifications to the model parameters can be done by editing the corresponding .xml files included in both 'Environments' and 'PlantParameters'.

<!-- Wissuwa: 
Crown roots have root hairs of 130-170 microns long
Crown roots have 25 roots/mm which would be (0.6mm thick) about 13.3 hairs/mm2 or 1330 hairs/cm2
Their longevity is a big mistery. But josefine observed that at the base of the crown at least half of the root hairs were still there. 

Josefine mostly finds 10, but only counted those sticking out on one side. 

L type are 120-160 long and have a density from 20-35 #/mm
S-type are 80-120 long and have a density 20-35 #/mm
